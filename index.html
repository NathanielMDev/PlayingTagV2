             When files are not stored correctly, they can easily get lost or become difficult to find. Poor file storage can lead to important files going missing or being hard to access on a computer. This can cause frustration and make it challenging to find and use the files you need for schoolwork, projects, or other important tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Data security risks:</strong>
            <br>
             Poor file storage practices can expose your files to security risks. If files are not properly stored on a computer, they can become vulnerable to unauthorized access or theft. This means that someone else could potentially access or delete your files without your permission. It is important to protect your files by storing them securely and using passwords to keep them safe from unwanted access.
